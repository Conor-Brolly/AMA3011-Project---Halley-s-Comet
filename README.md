# AMA 3011 Halley's Comet Project

This project aims to compare the analytical solutions of the orbit of Halley's comet to discrete timestep computaional problems.

I use three computational methods - Eulers' method, the midpoint method and Runge-Kutta to fourth order.


### POSSIBLE ERROR: The RK4 Model loses energy at high speeds / accelerations. This leads to it being less accurate than the Euler integration method.
